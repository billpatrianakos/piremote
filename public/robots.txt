# stumbling on our remote control website

# have to have security measures in place
# just in case a rude robot crawls the site
# or nefarious actors find us somehow. After
# all, we don't want our TVs and appliances
# suddenly changing channels or activating out
# of nowhere because someone came across an
# unprotected version of our site.
